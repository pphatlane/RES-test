To build and run Res api, you need to have visual studio and sql server management studio installed.
Then in the assessment folder there is DBCreate folder, inside that folder please run ResDbCreate fisrt to create db, and the CustomerAccountDetailsCreate to create a table.
To run vs code, unzip it and open RES.API.sln.
it took me 3 half days to complete this assessment.
